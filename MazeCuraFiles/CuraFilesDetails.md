#Details:

They may not be the correct size for certain servos, but scaling in Cura keeps the same ratios, so for this project
150% scaling was ALMOST close enough to fit our larger servos.


The instructable also includes a link to another project that has a python script to run in Blender to generate new
random mazes.  We were not able to get this to work right, so we used the pre-generated maze included in the project.
